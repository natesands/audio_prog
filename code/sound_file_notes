a soundfile contains audio data at a particular sample rate (in Hz). Standard
sample rates are 22,050, 44,100, 48,000, 96,000 and 192,000 (DVD audio).

A soundfile can contain several channels of audio - 1, 2, 6 (Dolby 5.1)

one frame contains sample data for each channel

soundfiles can contain samples in a range of data formats... most common format
is 16-bit, or C's short datatype.  (-32,767 to 32,767).  Other fomarts include:
- 24-bit "packed" (3 bytes)
- 32-bit floats
- 32-bit integer (C's long and int)
- 8-bit sample (older)
- 64-bit float (possible in AIFF and WAVE formats)


soundfiles can be written in a number of file formats, eg WAVE and AIFF,
Microsofts' WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE, the new AIFF-C format (designed by apple to
support range of compressed sample types plus added support for 32-bit floating
point format.  Or the user may provide a custom format...

speaker position:  
stereo:  channel 1 is front left, channel 2 is front right
in AIFF the channel configuration is ambiguous
only soundfile formats supporting unambiguous speaker positions are
WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE and new CAF file format (Apple)
